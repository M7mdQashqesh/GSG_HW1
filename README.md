# Simple Portfolio Website

This project is a simple portfolio website that I created as part of an assignment for the **Gaza Sky Geeks** course. The portfolio includes three main sections: **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact Me**.

### About Me

This section introduces who I am, including a brief biography and an overview of my skills and experience.

### Projects

In this section, I present a selection of my projects. Each project is briefly described and accompanied by any relevant links or images.

### Contact Me

This section contains a simple form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message to reach out to me directly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the website is built using semantic HTML elements.
